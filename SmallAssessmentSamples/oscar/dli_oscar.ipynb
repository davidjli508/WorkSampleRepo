    "### Opening Thoughts on the Use Case / Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to analyze the Member-Diagnosis-Drug Datasets and build a meaningful model to predict patient health statuses from prescription drug data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of strategizing and brainstorming when approaching any new tasks, its a important step to review the business requirements, success criteria, and anticipated challenges - identified by either the stakeholder/Data Scientist. \n",
    "This will overall lead to a more organized strategy when handling the task and identifying any potential technical/data/project risks as far in advance as possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business/Task Requirements:\n",
    "- Classifcation Model Type (based on requiring categories/labels of outcomes)\n",
    "- Column of Interest: TBD (some variety of patient health statuses, but to be defined as part of the task)\n",
    "- Predictive Features: Drugs administered\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Success Criteria:\n",
    "- Built a Classifcation Model using the Member-Diagnosis-Drug Datasets referenced.\n",
    "- Due to time constraints, accuracy is not the highest priority - but still best to do sanity checks and quick reviews. Especially with Data the company/individual/stakeholders are not necessarily familar with.\n",
    "- Write Organized Code with Helpful Documentation\n",
    "- Document Helpful Ideas and Thoughts along the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anticipated Challenges:\n",
    "- This is data we are not fully familiar with the collection and engineering process. So we should especially be on lookout for missing or low-quality data.\n",
    "- The domain knowledge of the data is somewhat niche, so it is important we take time and steps to thoroughly understand the medical-specific terminology and nomenclature. We will be sure to discuss investigative steps, learnings, and decisions based on these.\n",
    "- Part of the open-ended nature of this assignment is that we will need to define our own Target Column of interest. In some datasets this is immediately provided, but we will need to strategize accordingly."

    "### Ingestion/Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the Modeling is usually the more \"exciting\" part of the project, it's important to be well-informed on the data we are working with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to take a look at the variables individually (uni-variate) as well as check out possible few correlation/relationships between variables (bi-variate) that we suspect may have interesting patterns. Additionally, there are other vital reasons why EDA is strongly needed for successful and clean modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determining how to address missing/low-quality data upfront segments much of the Data Manipulation code away from the AI/ML Modelling Code, making corrections/revisions easy to add in the corresponding section (as vs. all of the code entangled together)  \n",
    "- Addressing all Data Quality Issues upfront eliminates confusion between a Data process issue vs. a Modelling process issue, which is extremely relevant when we need to identify the root cause of poor model performance or make model enhancements/improvements. It saves significant time.\n",
    "- It gives direction on how to initially approach the modelling steps. Learning what variables are poorly maintained, insignificant, or irrelevant can save significant time in deciding how to be constructing and setting up the model. It becomes easier to quickly start with a fairly reasonable model - especially great if deadlines or resources happen to be constrained. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular with this assessment, we have 3 datasets to review. The importance of this section is to roughly **determine the meaning, data quality, statistical overview, and important learnings/facts about the data that will be either a prerequisite or an a important factor in part of our modelling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the suggested 4 hour constraint, we will focus on the most evident learnings that we can quickly understand. There may be further analysis that could be done with more time - these potential steps are covered in the summary section of the EDA portion."

    "- \"record_id\" would assumedly be the unique transaction id logged to the drug being given to the member\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: this is not the same as the \"record_id\" as the claims_lines dataset.\n",
    "    - Validation Process: we could join \"record_id\" across the two datasets, and validate if the secondary data attributes (i.e. \"member_id\") are consistent.\n",
    "        - If this is validated to actually match, this could be our id to join on\n",
    "        - If not, we likely will need to join with other data attributes.\n",
    "- \"member_id\" would be the associated member for the drug being administered to.\n",
    "    - This likely would be consistent with the \"member_id\" seen in claims_lines (otherwise, the join between these datasets will be quite difficult)\n",
    "    - Validation Process: we could join these two \"member_id\"s and spot check for data consistency (i.e. diabetes patients are both diagnosed with diabetes AND are prescribed diabetes-treatment drugs)\n",
    "- \"date_svc\" is actually unclear whether this falls in one of two scenarios. \n",
    "    - Scenario 1: These correspond to the same \"date_svc\" as when the member received the diagnosis, as its purpose as an additional joining key\n",
    "    - Scenario 2: These are dates indicating when the prescription drug was filled, and completely specific within the scope of only the prescription drug dataset.\n",
    "        - Since dates are harder to intuitively validate, there may not be a clear cut strategy to find the answer to this.\n",
    "            - Consequence 1: As part of our data joining strategy, we would need to employ a strategy that will not be joining on \"date_svc\" to avoid misleading joins\n",
    "            - Consequence 2: Since we are uncertain about the consistency between multiple \"date_svc\" columns, we should exclude this as a predictive attribute from our final model since it could yield misleading insights - That is the risk of using data elements we don't understand.\n",
    "- \"ndc\" is the National Drug Code for the exact drug being used. Most likely, we will not need to use this column as we have the other columns describing the functional purpose of the drug (i.e We don't understand anything directly from proper Drug names like Tylenol - it is the properties and usages of Tylenol that we care about understanding from the drug name).\n",
    "- \"drug_category\", \"drug_group\", \"drug_class\" are helpful descriptors of the drug being used. Since there are so many unique drugs that exist, we will probably utilize these descriptions to determine how we will be broadly binning the drugs in functional groups as a model predictor input.\n",

    "### Theoretical Modelling Steps / Future Steps & Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the assessment, we've reached the respected limit for the assessment. However, this section will be dedicated to the following explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Our Final Model Dataset Expresses the Problem Statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "Our final Dataset depicts the combinations of drugs seen administered associated for any particular health status. The definitions were presented in our earlier section of model preparation. In technical terms - for any data row, we can establish particular health status and the drugs that were given to an individual with that health status. **This is an adequate layout for providing model predictive inputs (which drugs were used and which weren't) to predict a model classification (what health status we would anticipate or expect).** It is additionally fitting in that we could supply any kind of new or sample data, and could be applied easily to this dataset's form. The member ids were used for groupings to associate the required groupings, but effectively are not predictive as a trait itself and thus dropped in the final step of the model dataset preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What Model we would potentially employ, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a wide portfolio of classification models that would be tried here. We also identified that this is a supervised learning problem, with historical \"true\" labels we have acess to. Due to our desire of explainability as well as reasonable runtime, we could try a relatively robust model type such as Random Forests or XGBoosted Trees. The next steps would be to implement the related model code, train it with our dataset here, and assess its performance on test data (either set aside from the original dataset, or brand new data). Depending on the performance, there could be future iterations to continue improvements and utilize it for real predictions as described in the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages/Fit For This Problem Statement:\n",
    "- Tree Models are easy to interpret, as they visually represent how humans think similarly in tree forms.\n",
    "- Tree Models are quite accurate for a first-choice model, as supported by many online documentations https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/kaggle-blog-winners-posts/code\n",
    "- They compute relatively fast with better modern compute resources and more efficient packages that continue to release.\n",
    "- There is not a ton of hyperparameter requirements as compared to something like neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages/Concerns for this Problem Statement:\n",
    "- The Tree Model may react strangely to the extreme sparse nature of the dataset\n",
    "- There are many columns, which could greatly increase the runtime beyond what we could hope.\n",
    "- The categorization assumptions we have utilized may be too simple for what an optimal solution could entail.\n",
    "- Visually it may be hard to generate trees for explanations or stakeholder interaction, with many different tree decision points from all the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Other Extension/Explorative steps & Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "We re-summarize some areas of improvement and reasonable future steps if there was more time and/or this project was on a larger scope/scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We made multiple decisions & assumptions related on choosing relatively easy categorizations. With further data exploration, we could find a more ideal way of expressing both the drug categories and/or the health statuses that we are trying to predict.\n",
    "- Once we have a baseline model, it would be great to try alterative model algorithms and compare if the performance improves or is not as strong.\n",
    "- We could reshape the dataset in an alternative way that is still adequate for a model input, and see if the model improves on performance here.\n",
    "- For most classification models, there are metrics on evaluating the model performance. We had not talked about that in this assessment, but such metrics would include aspects such as misclassification rate, sensitivity/specificity, etc.\n",
    "- It would be a strong consideration to explore if there are other datasets that could supplement the information here."
